About Pytch
===========

.. caution::

   This documentation refers to an earlier version of Pytch.  We are
   in the process of updating it to reflect the current version.


Summary
-------

Pytch provides a stepping-stone in the journey from Scratch to Python.

Motivation
----------

The two most common teaching languages are Scratch and Python. Learners
often start by working with Scratch, and then at some point want to make
a transition to a text-based programming language; Python is a common
choice.

Many factors make the transition from Scratch to Python a difficult one.
Simplifying, we can see that there are two substantial differences:

-  Instead of assembling their program via drag and drop of interlocking
   blocks, the learner must type code into a text editor, attending to
   spelling, syntax, and so on.
-  Instead of an environment providing a set of concurrently running
   sprites, with built-in behaviours such as movement, costumes, and
   collision detection, the learner must work with an entirely new
   runtime, with a very different programming model.

Currently, the learner must make both these changes to their
understanding at the same time.

Pytch’s contribution
--------------------

We break this leap into two smaller steps. Pytch provides a programming
environment with the familiarity of Scratch’s model and runtime, but
where behaviour is expressed using textual Python code rather than
blocks. Pytch projects resemble Scratch projects, with a Stage and as
many interacting Sprites as required. The learner can concentrate on
becoming familiar with Python’s syntax.

Status
------

The implementation is at the prototype stage. We would very much welcome
feedback from people with experience of both Scratch and Python,
particularly those involved in education!

Acknowledgements
----------------

We rely heavily on the following two excellent projects:

-  `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/>`_ — MIT’s graphical programming
   environment, whose ideas are the motivation behind Pytch
-  `Skulpt <https://skulpt.org/>`_ — an in-browser implementation of
   the Python language, on which we have built Pytch

Licence
-------

TODO: Might be enough different licences involved to make it worth
having a separate "licensing" doc?
